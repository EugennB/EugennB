# Eugen Brodner

## Aspiring Junior Data Analyst

A technical, meticulous and creative person aspiring to progress in
the tech industry. An aspiring junior data analyst just finishing a Data
Science Bootcamp where I learned about Python, Data Visualisation,
Machine Learning and many more. I am hoping to acquire more
knowledge in the above mentioned, other tech fields and programming
languages by learning from peers and also by being an autodidact.
Working for more than 10 years in Hospitality from junior positions to
management has taught me patience, diligence, problem solving skills
and initiative and the importance of working in a team and educating
others.
